# Hi, I’m Swapnil Wankhede

I build **production-grade AI systems** focused on **reliability, cost, and performance**.

**Currently:** SDE AI INTERN @ Zentra Labs · CS @ SPIT Mumbai (2027)  
**Core work:** RAG systems, multi-agent pipelines, production ML infrastructure

---

## Selected Work

---

### FloatChat — Multi-agent analytical system

**Problem**  
Oceanographic data queries were slow, unreliable, and expensive.

**What I built**  
Multi-agent consensus system + physics validation + template-first SQL engine.

**Result**
- 3× reliability improvement  
- 80% of queries under 10ms  
- Deployed in production

### ProductionRAG — Multi-strategy retrieval system

**Problem**  
Single-strategy RAG had poor recall and high token cost.

**What I built**  
Parallel retrieval (dense + lexical + hybrid) + RRF + reranking pipeline.

**Result**
- 30% cost reduction  
- 35% recall improvement  
- 0.803 answer similarity on HotpotQA

### PatternPrep — Exam pattern intelligence system (Founder)

**Problem**  
Students prepare blindly without understanding exam patterns.

**What I’m building**  
A system that analyzes past papers, extracts patterns, and optimizes preparation strategy.

**Status**  
In active development

---

## What I Work On

- Production RAG systems  
- Multi-agent orchestration and evaluation  
- Cost and latency optimization  
- Turning research ideas into deployable systems  

---

## Tech Stack

**Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, PyTorch, LangChain, Chroma/Qdrant, Celery**

---

## Experience

- **SDE AI INTERN @ Zentra Labs** — building production AI systems  
- **Computer Science @ SPIT Mumbai** — Class of 2027  

---

## Focus Areas (2025–2026)

- AI security & adversarial ML  
- Robustness of LLM systems  
- Agent reliability and evaluation  
- Production-grade ML system design  

---

## Philosophy

> I optimize for systems that survive production, not demos.
