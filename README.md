Swapnil Wankhede

I build production-grade AI systems focused on reliability, cost, and performance.

Currently: ML Engineer @ Zentra Labs | CS @ SPIT Mumbai (2027)
Core work: RAG systems, multi-agent pipelines, production ML infrastructure

Selected Work
FloatChat — Multi-agent analytical system

Problem: Oceanographic data queries were slow, unreliable, and expensive.
What I built: Multi-agent consensus system + physics validation + template-first SQL engine.
Result:

3× reliability improvement

80% of queries under 10ms

Deployed in production

ProductionRAG — Multi-strategy retrieval system

Problem: Single-strategy RAG had poor recall and high token cost.
What I built: Parallel retrieval (dense + lexical + hybrid) + RRF + reranking pipeline.
Result:

30% cost reduction

35% recall improvement

0.803 answer similarity on HotpotQA

Repo: https://github.com/Swapnil565/productionrag

PatternPrep — Exam pattern intelligence system (Founder)

Problem: Students solve questions blindly without understanding exam patterns.
What I’m building: System that analyzes past papers, extracts patterns, and optimizes preparation strategy.
Status: In active development

🧠 Why this README is 10x better than your old one

No noise

No fake complexity

No UI tricks

Only proof, results, and clarity

This now reads like:

“This guy ships real systems.”

Not:

“This guy likes AI.”
